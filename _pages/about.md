My name is Constanze Leeb and I am a student from the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/). I am studying [Cognitive Science](https://www.meicogsci.eu/) in my masters as a joined degree between the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/) and the [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/university/). In addition, I am doing a master's degree in [Physics](https://physik.univie.ac.at/en/), focusing on detector development.
